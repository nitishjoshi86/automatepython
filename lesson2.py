a = 2+2
print(a)

#expression here can be +, -, /, *. Python will understand and you don't need to declare type of variable. if you write 3.4 it will consider a float so this type of things makes python very simple and easy to understand programming language. 

#python fundamentals actually has very small learning curve, you can go through fundamentals of python within a week. but the tools or stream you select will require you to explore everyday. It will have steep learning curve and requires forever practice because we never know what is next...

a = 3/7
print(type(a))

#here you can see that python automatically results type of a variable. we can also do multiple variable declaration in same statement shown below 

a, b = 9, 4
print(a,b)

#also multiple expression can be done in single statement where BODMAS rules will be apply. (brackets over first, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction)

c = (9+89)*4/2+98-3
print(c) 
#answer 291.0 because here 89+9=98/2=49*4=196+98=294-3=291.0, even if the answer is integer but if we have also included / division then answer will always come in float like below

d = 8/4
print(d)
#answer 2.0

e = 'nitish' + 'joshi' #same with strings, for +, *
print(e)

#python supports overriding the variables, new value gets assigned
